## Getting Started

Instead of creating a repository, you’ll publish a GitHub gist. GitHub describes a **gist** as a simple way to share code snippets with others. It’s also an ideal way to demonstrate a technique, teach a principle, or show off a solution. It functions just like a repository, and you’ll use Markdown to create it, just as you do with your READMEs. Gists can include code, images, links, and anything else you can include in a README.

Each section that describes a component should include more than just one sentence explaining what it does. It should also include a code snippet of that particular component and some examples that meet the requirements of that component.

> **Important**: Make revisions to your gist in the GitHub gist UI. This will create a revision history that graders can use to verify that the tutorial content is yours.
